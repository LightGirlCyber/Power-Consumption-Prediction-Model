Power-Consumption-Prediction-Model
Regression model for predicting power consumption using regression techniques.

Project Overview:
This project implements a comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline for power consumption prediction, developed as part of the German International University - Winter 2025 challenge.

Features:
- Advanced feature engineering with power factor-inspired physical features
- Box-Cox transformation for target variable
- Polynomial features with Ridge regression
- Cyclical encoding for temporal features
- Domain-driven electrical engineering features
